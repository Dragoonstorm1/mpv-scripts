Or "timeonly" to display files that have time only. Or "keywords" to display files with matching keywords specified in the configuration. Or "playing" to show bookmarks for current playing file.
##---available sort: "added-asc" is for the newest added bookmark to show first. Or "added-desc" for the newest added to show last. Or "alphanum-asc" is for A to Z approach with filename and episode number lower first. Or "alphanum-desc" is for its Z to A approach. Or "keybind-asc", or "keybind-desc" to sort based on keybinds which is execlusive to sort_slots_filter.

##--Jump to the following filters and in the shown sequence when navigating via left and right keys. You can change the sequence and delete filters that are not needed.
filters_and_sequence=["all", "slots", "protocols", "fileonly", "titleonly", "timeonly", "playing", "keywords"]
